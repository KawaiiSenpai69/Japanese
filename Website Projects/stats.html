This leads to the prediction that about 30% of population disappear 2060 if this trend keeps up, something that if left untreated, could be catastrophic.

			<br>
			Along with this, there has been a surge in the production and consumption of artifical romantic and sexual products, which not surprisingly, correlates with the decrease of ACTUAL and PHYSICAL relationships.

			Similar to the previous graph, this not only shows the increase of karoshi's within the country, but also the increase of government compensation required to these suicides. Karoshi in Japan is acknowledged by the government through compensations, but minial effort is done currently to reduce the number
